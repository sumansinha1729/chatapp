# Assets Folder

This folder is for app icons and splash screens.

Expo will generate default placeholder assets automatically when you first run the app, so you don't need to worry about creating these files.

If you want custom assets later, you can add:
- icon.png (1024x1024)
- splash.png (1284x2778)
- adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024 for Android)
- favicon.png (for web)

For now, the app will work fine without these!
